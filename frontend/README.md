# Frontend (Vite)

This folder contains the static frontend used by the CRM demo. A Vite dev server is provided for faster local development.

Quick start:

1. From this folder install dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The dev server will open at http://localhost:5173 and serve the `index.html` and other static pages.
